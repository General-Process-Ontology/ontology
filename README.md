# GPO

General Process Ontology (GPO), work in progress

Public repo: https://gitlab.cc-asp.fraunhofer.de/ISC-Public/ISC-Digital/ontology/gpo

## About

Basically, this ontology aims to model processes. Processes are holistic perspective elements that transform inputs/educts (matter, energy, information) into output/products (matter, energy, information) with the help of tools (devices, algorithms). They can be decomposed into sub-processes and have predecessor and successor processes. 

The GPO is a cross-project development under the coordination of Fraunhofer ISC (both EU and national research projects).
